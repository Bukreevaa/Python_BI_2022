The **matrix_multiplication** function takes two matrices, multiplies them according to the appropriate rules and outputs the resulting matrix. 
The function **multiplication_check**, takes a list with matrices, and gives True if they can be multiplied by each other in the order they are in the list, and False if they cannot be multiplied.
The function **multiply_matrices**, takes a list of matrices, and gives the result of multiplication if they can be obtained, or returns None if they cannot be multiplied.
The function **compute_2d_distance**, takes 2 one-dimensional arrays with a pair of values (as coordinates of a point in the plane) and calculates the distance between them.
The function **compute_multidimensional_distance**, taking 2 one-dimensional arrays with any number of values (but equal) and calculating the distance between them.
The function **compute_pair_distances** calculates a matrix of pairwise distances and gives it to the user.
