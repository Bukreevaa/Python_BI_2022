## Homework_6

This branch contains answers to the tasks assigned as part of the study of regular expressions in Python.

The **first task** was to parse the references file using regular expressions, and to write all the ftp links from there into the ftps file.

The **second task** required me to extract all the numbers from the story 2430 A.D.

In the **third task** we were asked to extract from the story 2430 A.D. all the words with the letter a in them. The case did not matter.

In the **fourth task** all exclamation sentences had to be extracted from 2430 A.D.

In the **fifth task** I had to build a histogram of the distribution of the lengths of unique words (not case-sensitive, length from 1) in the text.

In the **sixth task** it was necessary to make a function-translator from Russian to "brick language".
